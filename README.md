# Project Overview

This repository contains all the files to set up and maintain the Baizonn Learning Centre website. The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly and responsive website for our customers through the implementation of the underscores theme.

This theme has been modified specifically for Baizonn Learning Centre. It includes well-written code for future developers to understand and refine.
Installation

WordPress, Docker and AWS Lightsail will need to be installed and setup for this web server to be used.

To install this theme locally, follow these steps:

    Download the latest version of the theme from the GitHub repository (wp-content/themes/baizonn).
    Upload the theme folder to WordPress installation's wp-content/themes directory.
    Activate the theme from the WordPress admin panel.

## Usage

This theme is designed to be customisable, with a range of options available to help create the ideal WordPress site for refinement. Some of the key features of the theme include:
- Fully responsive design, optimised for mobile and desktop devices.
- Customisable header and footer templates.
- Custom page templates for different types of content.
- Page templates for different types of content.

To customise the theme, the theme files can be editted directly. A child theme would be more beneficial for more drastic changes to the template and content.
