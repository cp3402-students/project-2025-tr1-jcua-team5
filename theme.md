# Baizonn Theme Development Guide

## Theme Features
This WordPress theme, Baizonn, is a custom-built theme based off the starter theme, 'underscores'. Key features include:

- **Responsive Design**: The theme is designed to be fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
- **Custom Header**: A custom header section displays the site title and navigation menu.
- **Custom Footer**: The footer includes copyright details and other important links.
- **Page Layout**: Uses a fixed navbar and footer for constant access, with the main content centered.

## Files to Edit
To customise the theme, the following files are key:
- **header.php**: Contains the top section of the site, including the site title and main menu.
- **footer.php**: Displays the footer content with contact info and other relevant links.
- **style.css**: Controls the overall look and feel of the site. Adjust the colors, font sizes, and layout here.
- **functions.php**: Handles theme functionalities like setting up custom menus, widgets, and theme support.

## Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**: The theme uses a color palette of shades of green and pink for buttons and titles, ensuring a vibrant, engaging design that aligns with the learning center's branding.
- **Typography**: Weâ€™ve chosen a clean sans-serif font (Segoe UI and Roboto) for readability and modern aesthetics.
- **Layout**: The layout has been designed to be simple, with clear navigation and easily accessible content. The content is centered with a fixed navbar and footer for improved user experience.

## Customisations
If continuing development, use `style.css` to further refine stylistic elements of the site. For new features, add or modify the theme functionality in `functions.php`.
