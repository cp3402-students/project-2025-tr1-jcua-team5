    <p><u>Nurturing a Love For Learning</u></p>
	<p>For over 10 years, we have helped students achieve success in school and in life by nurturing a love for learning.
	From primary school to junior college, our students enjoy fun, interactive and relevant lessons and are
	empowered to think beyond the confines of the classroom. </p>

	<p>At Baizonn Learning Center, we strongly believe in Building a Strong Foundation on Grasping Maths and
	Science Principles</p>

	<p><u>Preparing Students To Achieve Success</u></p>
	<p>Developing Confident and Successful Learners.
	Our students are at the centre of everything we do and their well-being and success in learning matter to
	us.</p>

	<p>While we educate our students, we also equip them with the right knowledge, skills and attitudes that
	help them solve problems, think big and seek excellence.</p>

	<p><u>Passionate Teachers That Make A Difference</u></p>
	<p>At Baizonn Learning Center, our teachers motivate and nurture every student to achieve their best and
	to build the right attitudes to ingrain a love for learning.</p>

	<p>We hire teachers with the right passion and qualifications and equip them to create amazing classroom
experiences for their students.
Weâ€™re committed to bringing out the best in every student.</p>
